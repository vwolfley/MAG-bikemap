            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This map is intended to aid bike riders in choosing routes between locations. This map is not in any way a warranty or guarantee as to the stability of roadway conditions or the fitness of listed routes for riding bikes. Many of the routes identified on this map cross or run along public roads which are exposed to wear and tear and degradation due to weather, traffic, and other environmental concerns. Riders should remain alert as routes may contain pavement rutting, cracks, bumps, expansion joints, natural or other debris on pavement surfaces, and vegetation which may encroach on routes or portions thereof. Riders should also remain alert for areas of visual impairment and other irregularities that may impact rider and motorist ability to see each other or potential road hazards. The chance that one may come into an area of visual impairment or a route irregularity warrants special care on the part of route users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Government resources limit the capacity to address conditions and irregularities like those described above. Accordingly, route users should maintain a vigilant lookout for these conditions and irregularities. Route users are urged to exercise discretion when choosing where and when to ride based on personal comfort and safety and the comfort and safety of others. Safe route selection includes consideration of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic and roadway or route conditions. MAG does not assume liability for bike riders traveling upon routes shown in this map.
