        routes may contain pavement rutting, cracks, bumps, expansion joints, natural or other debris on pavement surfaces,
        and vegetation which may encroach on routes or portions thereof. Riders should also remain alert for areas of visual
        impairment and other irregularities that may impact rider and motorist ability to see each other or potential road
        hazards. The chance that one may come into an area of visual impairment or a route irregularity warrants special
        care on the part of route users.
        <br> Government resources limit the capacity to address conditions and irregularities like those described above. Accordingly,
        route users should maintain a vigilant lookout for these conditions and irregularities. Route users are urged to
        exercise discretion when choosing where and when to ride based on personal comfort and safety and the comfort and
        safety of others. Safe route selection includes consideration of motor vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic and
        roadway or route conditions. MAG does not assume liability for bike riders traveling upon routes shown in this map.
