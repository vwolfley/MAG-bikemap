            The MAG Bikeways map shows existing, locally-designated bicycle facilities, and is
            provided to you by the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG).
            This map has been produced under the direction of the MAG Regional Bicycle Task Force.
            Funding was provided by the Federal Highway Administration.  If you have any comments,
            please call MAG at (602) 254-6300 or visit our web site at www.azmag.gov.

            <b>Disclaimer:</b>This map is intended to aid bicyclists in choosing routes
            between locations. This map is not in any way a warranty or guarantee as
            to the stability of roadway conditions or the fitness of listed routes
            for bicycling. Many of the routes identified on this map cross or run along
            public roads which are exposed to wear and tear and degradation due to
            weather, traffic, and other environmental concerns. Riders should remain
            alert as routes may contain pavement rutting, cracks, bumps, expansion
            joints, natural or other debris on pavement surfaces, and vegetation which
            may encroach on routes or portions thereof. Riders should also remain alert
            for areas of visual impairment and other irregularities that may impact
            rider and motorist ability to see each other or potential road hazards.
            The chance that one may come into an area of visual impairment or a route
            irregularity warrants special care on the part of route users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Government resources limit the capacity to address conditions and irregularities
            like those described above. Accordingly, route users should maintain a
            vigilant lookout for these conditions and irregularities. Route users should
            always ride with care for their own safety and that of other users. MAG
            does not assume liability for bicyclists traveling upon routes
            shown in this map. Safe route selection includes consideration of motor
            vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian traffic and roadway or route conditions.
